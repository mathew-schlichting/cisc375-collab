            <p>
                ChatBlocs is a collaborative video, text message and drawing app.
                A user has to join a room to participate, selecting a color and
                username as they do so (the color will be used to identify this user
                in the text message box).  Each room is limited to four users.
                The users in each room are able to start a video call among themselves. In addition,
                they can each see what the others write in the chat box as well as what everyone
                draws on the canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                ChatBlocs uses WebRTC to make video and audio connections between users.
                It also uses SocketIO to communicate between the users in each room,
                facilitate collaborative drawing, and signal between the pages.
                It also uses the jQuery and AngularJS frameworks to navigate between rooms
                and facilitate user interaction with the page.
            </p>

            <p>  My name is Mathew Schlichting. I graduated from the University
                of St. Thomas in May of 2018. I have been programing since I was 15 when I took my first
                college level computer science course. I fell in love with computers ever since. I have taken
                as many computer science courses as possible during my college career. In addition, I graduated
                with a 3.99 GPA and Summa Cum Laude honors. I have done research for the University of St.
                Thomas which was published in August of 2017. </p>

                Emily is a fourth-year student at the University of St. Thomas and will graduate this May with a major in Computer Science and minors in music, Catholic Studies, and Latin. She has previously enjoyed reading, playing the piano, and knitting and is looking
                forward to engaging in these hobbies again a week from the submission of this project.
